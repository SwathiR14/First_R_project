```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# load the data

First, need to load the data using read.csv to load the gapminder data.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("Data/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(dat)
```

# Plot the data

## Setup

We need to load the ggplot2 package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Plotting

```{r}
ggplot( data = dat,
        mapping = aes( x = year,
                       y = lifeExp,
                       by = country,
                       color = continent)) + facet_wrap(~continent) + geom_line() + theme_classic()
```

## Inserting pre-made figure

We have a figure at "data/figures/life_exp.png". How to insert it into our report?

```{r, fig.cap = "Life Expectancy vs Year, for each country, facetted by continent"}
knitr::include_graphics("Data/Figures/life_Exp.png")
```
